CHAPTER 8: THE DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM
"""

"""
1. A sinusoid at 1.7 kHz is digitized at 10,000 samples per second.  The
signal is passed through a 2048 point DFT, and converted to polar form. Draw
four sketches of the magnitude, one for each of the four ways that the
frequency domain's independent variable can be expressed. Be sure to
indicate the frequency symbol used, the range of values, the units, and at
what frequency the sinusoid appears. 
"""

"""
2. A peak appears at index number 19 when a 256 point DFT is taken of a
signal.  

a. What is the frequency of the peak expressed as a fraction of the sampling
rate? Do you need to know the actual sampling rate to answer this question?
b. What is the frequency of the peak expressed as a natural frequency?
c. What is the sampling rate if the peak corresponds to 21.5 kHz in the
analog signal?
d. What is the frequency of the sinusoid (in hertz) if the sampling rate is
100 kHz?

4. An 8 sample signal is given by: 20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27.  Its frequency
domain is given by: R0,R1,R2,R3,R4 and I0,I1,I2,I3,I4.  Write the
simultaneous equations relating the frequency domain and the time domain.
Use the numerical value for each point in the basis functions, for example,
use 0.7071, not sin(pi/4). How difficult would it be to solve these
equations?
