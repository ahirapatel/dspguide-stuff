1. A signal contains 100,000 samples, and each sample is  represented by 10
bits.  Assume that addition and subtraction require 1 microsecond,
multiplication and division require 3 microseconds, the square-root requires
10 microseconds, and other programming actions (such as array indexing and
loop control) are negligible.  Find the time required to calculate the mean
and standard deviation of the signal using:  

a. The direct method, as shown in Table 2-1.
b. Running statistics, as shown in Table 2-2.  
(You will need to modify the program in Table 2-2 to calculate the mean and
standard deviation only of the entire signal, not after each point.  That
is, move the NEXT I% in line 320 to line 250).
c. The histogram method, as shown in Table 2-3.
d. Repeat (c) for the case that each sample is represented by 32 bits.  How
much memory is required to hold the histogram for this calculation, assuming
each bin requires two bytes?

2.  You are asked to evaluate a new device for detecting cancer in humans. 
When a healthy person is tested, the device produces a number that follows a
normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 10. When
a person with cancer is examined, the resulting number is normally
distributed with a mean of 120 and a standard deviation of 8. When the
device is used on a person of unknown health, a threshold of 110 is used to
make the diagnosis: if the reading is < 110, the person is classified as
healthy; if the reading is > 110, the person is considered to have cancer.

a. Sketch the two pdfs, and indicate on your sketch the location of the
threshold.
--> Two gaussian curves, centered peak is on mean.

b. For the healthy distribution, how many standard deviations above the mean
is the threshold? 
--> 1 standard deviation

c. For the sick distribution, how many standard deviations below the mean is
the threshold?
--> 1.25 standard deviation

d. If a healthy person is tested with the system, what is the probability
that the reading produced will be less than 110? Greater than 110?
--> 84.13%, 15.87%

e. If a sick person is tested with the system, what is the probability that
the reading produced will be less than 110? Greater than 110?
--> (.1151+.0968) / 2, 1 - ((.1151+.0968) / 2)

f. What percentage of sick patients are incorrectly classified as healthy?  
--> (.1151+.0968) / 2

g. What percentage of healthy patients are incorrectly classified as sick.
--> 84.13%


3. Using the same cancer detection system as in problem 2, where should the
threshold be set to insure that 99% of all sick persons being examined are
reported as sick? At this threshold, what fraction of healthy persons are
incorrectly reported as being sick?  
--> 2.3 standard deviations from the mean (2.3*8 + 120) = 138.4
--> (138.4 - 110) / 10 = 2.84 standard deviations above from mean, so ~99% of
    healthy dudes will be incorrectly classified as cancerous

4. Twelve financial experts are asked to predict the stock market price 30
days in advance.  The values they provide are: 996, 868, 855, 956, 867, 933,
866, 887, 936, 901, 818, 956. In 30 days, the true stock market price is
found to be 876. 

a.  What is the mean of the predictions?
--> [996, 868, 855, 956, 867, 933, 866, 887, 936, 901, 818, 956] / NUM = 903.25
b.  What is the standard deviation of the predictions?
--> 52.166
c.  What is the accuracy of the experts' prediction?  
--> 903.25 - 876 = 27.25
d.  What is the precision of an experts' prediction?  
--> 52.166


5. An astronomer measures the brightness of a star on 30 consecutive nights. 
Due to atmospheric turbulence and other random errors, the measurements have
a coefficient-of-variation of 3.0%. One of the measurements is found to be
6.9% higher than the average.   
-->CV = std / mean * 100
-->SNR = mean / std

a. What is the signal-to-noise ratio of the 30 sample signal?
-->3.0 = std / mean * 100
-->.03 = std / mean
-->.03 ^ -1 = mean / std
-->33.333 = mean / std
-->SNR = 33.33

b. What is the probability that any one measurement will be at least 6.9%
higher than the mean from random error?
--> I have no idea
--> 1/30 = .0333333
c. Can the astronomer conclude that the 6.9% reading is a result of the star
changing in brightness? Explain.  
d. Repeat (b) and (c) for the high measurement being 10.2% above the mean.  


6. When two or more random signals are added, the resulting signal has a
mean equal to the sum of the means of the component signals.  Likewise, the
variance of the resulting signal is equal to the sum of the variances of the
component signals.  Derive an equation showing how the standard deviation of
the resulting signal is related to the standard deviations of the component
signals. (This is often called "adding in quadrature").
--> Add two siggies then variance can be expressed as v1+v2
--> variance = v1+v2
--> variance = standard_deviation^2
---> standard_deviation^2 = v1+v2
---> standard_deviation = sqrt(v1+v2)

7. Find the mean and SD of the signal that results from adding the random
signals indicated.   

a. 1 volt mean, 20 mV SD; 1 volt mean, 20 mV SD.
--> 2 volt mean, sqrt(20^2 + 20^2) mV SD
---> 2 volt mean, 28.284 mV SD
b. 1 volt mean, 20 mV SD; 1 volt mean, 2 mV SD.
--> 2 volt mean, 20.100 mV SD
c. 1 volt mean, 20 mV SD; 1 volt mean, 0.2 mV SD.
--> 2 volt mean, 20.001 mV SD
d. 3 volt mean, 10 mV SD; 5 volt mean, 15 mV SD.
--> 8 volt mean, 18.028 mV SD
e. 10 volt mean, 10 mV SD; 5 volt mean, 15 mV SD; 0.2 Volt mean, 100 mV SD. 
--> 15 volt mean, 18.028 mV SD, Look this is one random signal now so we just merge it with #3 there right?
---> 15.2 volt mean, 101.612 mv SD

8. Electronic systems contain many noise sources; however, the total noise
of a system is usually dominated by only one of these noise sources.  Based
on your answers in the last two problems, explain why this is so.   
--> variance is additive for combining signals, so larger one will cause largest change in variance.
--> Okay, I am bad at english.
