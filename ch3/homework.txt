CHAPTER 3: ADC AND DAC

1. Specify how many bits are needed to appropriately digitize each of the 
following signals.  Choose from: 6 bits, 8 bits, 10 bits, 12 bits, 14 bits, 
or 16 bits. 

a. A signal where the maximum amplitude is 1 volt and the rms noise is 1.5
millivolts.  
b. A signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 900 to 1. 
c. A signal with a coefficient-of-variation of 0.4%. 
d. A high-fidelity audio system (hint: a jack-hammer is about 50,000 times
louder than a pin drop). 
e. A black and white digital image (hint: under the best conditions, the 
human eye can differentiate about 200 shades of gray between pure black and 
pure white). 


2. A scientist evaluates two different digital thermometers.  Each has a 
digital read-out to the nearest one degree, and updates once each second.  
When the temperature is held constant, the digital display of thermometer A
does not change, but the display of thermometer B randomly toggles between
three to four adjacent readings (i.e., +/- 2 degrees).  For the questions 
below, assume that the temperature is held constant.  

a. What is the largest possible error in an individual reading from A? 
b. What is the largest possible error in an individual reading from B?
c. In a single reading, which provides the "best" information?  Explain.   
d. If 1000 readings are taken with A, what is the standard deviation? 
e. If 1000 readings are taken with B, what is the approximate standard
deviation? (choose from 0.1, 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0).  
f. If 1000 readings are taken with thermometer B, what is the "typical error
between the mean of the readings, and the mean of the underlying process?  
g. If 1000 readings are taken with each thermometer, which data set provides
the "best" information? Explain.  
h. How many readings must be taken with thermometer A to reliably detect a
temperature change of 0.15 degrees?  (choose from 10, 100, 1000, 1 million,
1 billion, or "it cannot be done").  Explain.  
i. Repeat (h) for thermometer B.  


3. An engineer designs a microprocessor controlled ADC board that can 
acquire an 8 bit sample every 10 microseconds.  His boss walks in and says:
"You'll get a raise if the system can be modified to acquire a 12 bit sample
every 100 milliseconds- but it needs to be done by tomorrow!"  The first
thing the engineer does is to measure the noise on the analog signal
entering the ADC chip. He then smiles, and plans how to spend the extra
money. In detail, explain what the engineer was looking for in the noise
measurement, and how he can make the modification.  


4. An analog electronic signal is composed of three sine waves: 1 kHz @ 1 
volt amplitude, 3 kHz @ 2 volts amplitude, and 4 kHz @ 5 volts amplitude
(all voltage readings are peak-to-peak).  The signal is digitized with 12
bits, spread over the range of -5 volts to +5 volts.  For each sampling rate
below, describe the frequency components that exist in the digital signal.
Be sure to specify three things for each component: its digital frequency (a
number between 0 and 0.5), its amplitude (in digital numbers, peak-to-peak),
and its phase relative to the original analog signal (either 0 degrees or
180 degrees).  

a. Sampling rate = 100 kHz. 
b. Sampling rate = 10 kHz.
c. Sampling rate = 7.5 kHz.
d. Sampling rate = 5.5 kHz.
e. Sampling rate = 5 kHz.
f. Sampling rate = 1.7 kHz.


5. A high-fidelity audio signal (containing frequencies between 20 Hz and 20
kHz) is contaminated with interference from a nearby switching power supply,
operating at 32 kHz.  To eliminate the interference, the analog signal is
passed through an 8 pole Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 24
kHz. The filtered signal is then digitized at 44 kHz.  

a. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the analog signal, showing: 
the audio frequency band, the interfering signal, the frequency response of
the filter, one-half the sampling frequency, and the sampling frequency.   

# See poorly drawn diagram on paper.

b. What is the approximate attenuation of the filter at the frequency of the
interference?  

# See paper

c. What is the effect of the filter on the audio information?   
d. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal, showing: 
the audio frequency band, and the interfering signal.  
e. At what frequency does the aliased interference appear in the digitized 
signal?  
f. If an 8 pole Chebyshev filter (6% ripple) were used instead, how would
the amplitude of the aliased interference change?  
g. Repeat (a)-(f) with the cutoff frequency of the filter set at 20 kHz.   


6. A multirate technique is used to handle the interference in the last
problem.  The original analog signal (with interference) is digitized at a
sampling rate of 176 kHz.  A low-pass digital filter then removes all
digital  frequencies above 0.18 with less than a 0.02% residue, while
passing all  frequencies below 0.12 with less than a 0.02% passband ripple
(an easy task  for a digital filter).  The digital signal is then resampled
at 44 kHz, that is, every three out of four samples are discarded.  

a. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal before 
filtering, showing: the audio frequency band, the interfering signal, and
the approximate frequency response of the digital filter.
b. Has aliasing occurred during the sampling? Explain.  
c. In a fair comparison, should this digital filter be compared against the 
analog Butterworth filter, or the analog Chebyshev filter? Explain.   
d. How much better is the digital filter performing compared to the analog 
filter you indicated in (c)?  (It can be difficult to compare analog and
digital filters; make some sort of quantitative comparison, and explain your
method).  
e. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal after 
resampling, showing: the audio frequency band, and any interfering signals. 


7. On television, rotating objects such as wagon wheels and airplane
propellers often appear to be moving very slowly or even backwards.  This is
a result of aliasing, caused by the sampling rate of the video (30 frames
per second) being less than twice the frequency of the rotational motion. To
understand this, imagine we paint one of the blades of an airplane propeller
so that we can identify it from the other blades.  We will then turn the
propeller at 33 rotations per second, in a clockwise direction. In frame
number 1 of our video sequence, the marked blade happens to be exactly at
the top of the propeller.   

a. How many rotations does the marked blade make between two successive
frames?  
b. Draw a sketch of how the propeller would appear in frames 1, 2, 3 and 4.
c. How many frames does it take for the marked blade to again appear at the
top?  
d. What rotational frequency is (c) in rotations per second?   
e. Is this apparent rotation clockwise or counterclockwise? 
f. Explain using Fig. 3-4 how the marked blade's actual frequency, the frame
rate, and the marked blade's observed frequency are related.   
g. Repeat (a) to (f) when the propeller is turning at 57 rotations per
second.


8. When viewed on television at 30 frames per second, what is the apparent
rotational rate of a 4 blade propeller, turning at 44.7 rotations per
second, if all the blades are identical?  Is the apparent rotation clockwise
or counterclockwise?  
44.7 * 4 = 178.8 times per second the image will look the same.
178.8 / 30 = 5.96 frames to look the same

Example cuz I get confused real easy:
if propeller rate == 1 Hz, and sample rate == 4Hz
1 * 4 = 4 times per second image looks the same
4 times / 4 Hz sampling = 1 frame to look the same

if propeller rate == 2 Hz, and sample rate == 4Hz
2 * 4 = 4 times per second image looks the same
8 times / 4 Hz sampling = 2 frames to look the same
