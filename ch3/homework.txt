following signals.  Choose from: 6 bits, 8 bits, 10 bits, 12 bits, 14 bits, 
or 16 bits. 

2**6 = 64

2**12 = 4096
2**14 = 16384
2**16 = 65536

a. A signal where the maximum amplitude is 1 volt and the rms noise is 1.5
millivolts.  

# Make sure noise is low compared to LSB

## How much each lsb is for max voltage of 1V (column 1),
## and how much noise is 1.5mv related to LSB (column 2),
## and how much the total noise is via adding in quadrature (sqrt(x^2+.29^2))
### 6 bits 15.625mV LSB           , .096 LSB   , 0.3054766766874355

b. A signal with a signal-to-noise ratio of 900 to 1.
You want enough bits to represent atleast 900 separate values.
You want quantization and noise added together to not dominate signal.
Josh says 12 bits.


c. A signal with a coefficient-of-variation of 0.4%. 
10 bits


d. A high-fidelity audio system (hint: a jack-hammer is about 50,000 times
louder than a pin drop).
# units in pin drops
## Just assume max amplitude is 50,000, and pin drop is noise of 1
## How much each lsb is for max voltage of 1V (column 1),
## and how much noise is 1.5mv related to LSB (column 2),
## and how much the total noise is via adding in quadrature (sqrt(x^2+.29^2))
### 6 bits  781.25 pin drops LSB, .00128 LSB , 0.29000282481382833

16 bits, it can see the noise actually

e. A black and white digital image (hint: under the best conditions, the 
human eye can differentiate about 200 shades of gray between pure black and 
pure white).
### 8 bits because we need atleast 200 values, but 8 bits can fit 256
### Does this account for quantization noise enough?


2. A scientist evaluates two different digital thermometers.  Each has a 
digital read-out to the nearest one degree, and updates once each second.  
When the temperature is held constant, the digital display of thermometer A
does not change, but the display of thermometer B randomly toggles between
three to four adjacent readings (i.e., +/- 2 degrees).  For the questions 
below, assume that the temperature is held constant.  

a. What is the largest possible error in an individual reading from A? 
## +/- .5 degrees

b. What is the largest possible error in an individual reading from B?
## Assuming +/- 2 degrees in question refers to difference in each adjacent
## reading and not total difference
## It reads to nearest whole degree, so error in measuring is .5 degree
## Error in actually measuring is about 2 degrees
## +/- 2.5 degrees

c. In a single reading, which provides the "best" information?  Explain.   
## thermometer A, as the temperature of the liquid stays constant and it does
## not change.

d. If 1000 readings are taken with A, what is the standard deviation? 
## 0

e. If 1000 readings are taken with B, what is the approximate standard
deviation? (choose from 0.1, 0.5, 2.0 and 4.0).  
# 2.0?

f. If 1000 readings are taken with thermometer B, what is the "typical error
between the mean of the readings, and the mean of the underlying process?  
# use the formular:
## Typical error = standard_deviation / Num_samples^.5

g. If 1000 readings are taken with each thermometer, which data set provides
the "best" information? Explain.  
## Thermometer B probably, the dither effect could be used to get some extra
## precision between degrees, eg 500 samples of 5 degrees, and 500 of 6 degrees
## could actually indicate 5.5 degrees. 

h. How many readings must be taken with thermometer A to reliably detect a
temperature change of 0.15 degrees?  (choose from 10, 100, 1000, 1 million,
1 billion, or "it cannot be done").  Explain.  
i. Repeat (h) for thermometer B.  
## I'd think in this scenario provided it cannot be done for thermometer A
## For thermometer b, I am unsure


3. An engineer designs a microprocessor controlled ADC board that can 
acquire an 8 bit sample every 10 microseconds.  His boss walks in and says:
"You'll get a raise if the system can be modified to acquire a 12 bit sample
every 100 milliseconds- but it needs to be done by tomorrow!"  The first
thing the engineer does is to measure the noise on the analog signal
entering the ADC chip. He then smiles, and plans how to spend the extra
money. In detail, explain what the engineer was looking for in the noise
measurement, and how he can make the modification.  

## 100 milliseconds == 100000 microseconds
## so 8 bit with 10 microseconds VS 12 bit with 100000 microseconds
## The dude saw there was enough noise to use a dithering and average like effect.
## He could just increase the step sizes of the 8 bit samples to have a total range
## equal to the 12 bit sample, then he could get a series of samples every 10 microseconds
## until he reaches a 100,000 microsecond period and average the values. In summation,
## dithering.

4. An analog electronic signal is composed of three sine waves: 1 kHz @ 1 
volt amplitude, 3 kHz @ 2 volts amplitude, and 4 kHz @ 5 volts amplitude
(all voltage readings are peak-to-peak).  The signal is digitized with 12
bits, spread over the range of -5 volts to +5 volts.  For each sampling rate
below, describe the frequency components that exist in the digital signal.
Be sure to specify three things for each component: its digital frequency (a
number between 0 and 0.5), its amplitude (in digital numbers, peak-to-peak),
and its phase relative to the original analog signal (either 0 degrees or
180 degrees).  

a. Sampling rate = 100 kHz. 
b. Sampling rate = 10 kHz.
c. Sampling rate = 7.5 kHz.
d. Sampling rate = 5.5 kHz.
e. Sampling rate = 5 kHz.
f. Sampling rate = 1.7 kHz.

5. A high-fidelity audio signal (containing frequencies between 20 Hz and 20
kHz) is contaminated with interference from a nearby switching power supply,
operating at 32 kHz.  To eliminate the interference, the analog signal is
passed through an 8 pole Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 24
kHz. The filtered signal is then digitized at 44 kHz.  

a. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the analog signal, showing: 
the audio frequency band, the interfering signal, the frequency response of
the filter, one-half the sampling frequency, and the sampling frequency.   

# See poorly drawn diagram on paper.

b. What is the approximate attenuation of the filter at the frequency of the
interference?  

# See paper

c. What is the effect of the filter on the audio information?

# Not much. Dude says in book sound is frequency encoded so butterworth shouldn't impact
# the audible characteristics much and since the data is from 20 Hz to 20 kHz,
# the data should not be attentuated by the filter too much.

d. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal, showing: 
the audio frequency band, and the interfering signal.  

# See paper

e. At what frequency does the aliased interference appear in the digitized 
signal?  

# it would be at 12 kHz

f. If an 8 pole Chebyshev filter (6% ripple) were used instead, how would
the amplitude of the aliased interference change?  

# see paper

g. Repeat (a)-(f) with the cutoff frequency of the filter set at 20 kHz.   

# see paper


6. A multirate technique is used to handle the interference in the last
problem.  The original analog signal (with interference) is digitized at a
sampling rate of 176 kHz.  A low-pass digital filter then removes all
digital  frequencies above 0.18 with less than a 0.02% residue, while
passing all  frequencies below 0.12 with less than a 0.02% passband ripple
(an easy task  for a digital filter).  The digital signal is then resampled
at 44 kHz, that is, every three out of four samples are discarded.  

a. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal before 
filtering, showing: the audio frequency band, the interfering signal, and
the approximate frequency response of the digital filter.

b. Has aliasing occurred during the sampling? Explain.  

c. In a fair comparison, should this digital filter be compared against the 
analog Butterworth filter, or the analog Chebyshev filter? Explain.   

d. How much better is the digital filter performing compared to the analog 
filter you indicated in (c)?  (It can be difficult to compare analog and
digital filters; make some sort of quantitative comparison, and explain your
method).  

e. Sketch and label the frequency spectrum of the digital signal after 
resampling, showing: the audio frequency band, and any interfering signals. 


7. On television, rotating objects such as wagon wheels and airplane
propellers often appear to be moving very slowly or even backwards.  This is
a result of aliasing, caused by the sampling rate of the video (30 frames
per second) being less than twice the frequency of the rotational motion. To
understand this, imagine we paint one of the blades of an airplane propeller
so that we can identify it from the other blades.  We will then turn the
propeller at 33 rotations per second, in a clockwise direction. In frame
number 1 of our video sequence, the marked blade happens to be exactly at
the top of the propeller.   

a. How many rotations does the marked blade make between two successive
frames?  
# 30 fps
# 33 rps 
## 33 rps / 30 fps = 1.1 rpf

b. Draw a sketch of how the propeller would appear in frames 1, 2, 3 and 4.



c. How many frames does it take for the marked blade to again appear at the
top? 
# 1.1 rpf => next whole number multiple is 11, so 11/1.1 = 10 frames per full rotation

d. What rotational frequency is (c) in rotations per second?   
10 frames per full rotation, 30 frames per second = 30 / 10 = 3 rps

e. Is this apparent rotation clockwise or counterclockwise? 
# 1.1 rpf - 1 => .1 digital frequency, therefore clockwise cuz phase is same
# clockwise

f. Explain using Fig. 3-4 how the marked blade's actual frequency, the frame
rate, and the marked blade's observed frequency are related.   
# fps = sampling rate
# observed frequency = .1 digital freq
# actual frequency = 1.1 analog freq in diagram

g. Repeat (a) to (f) when the propeller is turning at 57 rotations per
second.


8. When viewed on television at 30 frames per second, what is the apparent
rotational rate of a 4 blade propeller, turning at 44.7 rotations per
second, if all the blades are identical?  Is the apparent rotation clockwise
or counterclockwise?  

44.7 * 4 = 178.8 times per second the image will look the same.
178.8 / 30 = 5.96 frames to look the same
5.96 => .96, this indicates phase shift
1-.96 = .04 digital frequency

apparent rotational rate:
.04 * sampling rate = .04 * 30 = 1.2  ?
.04 ^ -1 = 25 ?

Therefore, it is counterclockwise if it was clockwise originally.

Example cuz I get confused real easy:
if propeller rate == 1 Hz, and sample rate == 4Hz
1 * 4 = 4 times per second image looks the same
4 times / 4 Hz sampling = 1 frame to look the same

if propeller rate == 2 Hz, and sample rate == 4Hz
2 * 4 = 4 times per second image looks the same
8 times / 4 Hz sampling = 2 frames to look the same
