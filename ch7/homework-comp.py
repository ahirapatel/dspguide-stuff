CHAPTER 7: PROPERTIES OF CONVOLUTION

The exercise looks at two different ways of detect a known waveform in a
noisy signal.  The waveform to be detected is an exponentially decaying
pulse. The first detection method is to threshold the first difference of
the signal.  The second method is to threshold the correlation of the signal
with the known waveform. 

1.  Generate a 600 sample test signal, containing three target pulses:

x[n] =  exp(-(n-100)/15), if   99 < n < 160
     =  exp(-(n-300)/15), if  299 < n < 360
     =  exp(-(n-500)/15), if  499 < n < 560
     =  0, otherwise
"""

siggy = [exp(-(n-100)/15) if 99 < n < 160 else
     exp(-(n-300)/15) if 299 < n < 360 else
     exp(-(n-500)/15) if 499 < n < 560 else
     0
     for n in range(600)]

matplotlib.pyplot.plot(siggy, marker='.')

2. Generate a 600 sample signal of normally distributed random noise with
mean = 0, and SD = 1.
"""
import random
#               gauss(mean,std)
rands = [random.gauss(0,1) for _ in range(600)]

#from statistics import stdev
#print("stdev {}, average {}".format(stdev(rands), sum(rands)/len(rands)))

"""
3. Generate four test signals with signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of 50, 10,
5, and 2.5. Do this by adding the signal from step 1, with an appropriately
scaled version of the noise from step 2. For this problem, we will define
the SNR to be equal to the peak amplitude of the target waveform (which is
one), divided by the standard deviation of the noise.  Plot these four test
signals.

6. Based on your results, estimate the minimum SNR that the signal must have
in order to reliably detect the target by:

a. a visual inspection of the waveform
b. thresholding the first difference
c. thresholding the correlation signal

# a. Visually you can tell for each of the SNRs, but all but SNR50 look janky
# b. SNR 50, SNR 10 are pretty good if you put a threshold on it, the rest are iffy.
